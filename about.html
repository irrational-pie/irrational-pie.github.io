  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p> Hello! I'm Tina, a third-year Ph.D student at the Statistics Department at Columbia University. I earned my Bachelor of Arts in computer science and mathematics from Bard College.
    My current research focuses on inferring copy number states from single-cell sequencing data, while my past research explored the effectiveness of new cancer immunotherapy through agent-based models.
