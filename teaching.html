  <h1>My teaching experience </h1>
  <p> I have been teaching math and computer science in some capacity since 2016, when I was a Sophomore in high school. I started volunteering as a math homework helper at a local library, and accepted my first job as an SAT math tutor at a local test prep center. Then, I worked as a course tutor all four years of college, and eventually transitioned into my role as a TA at Columbia University. </p>
  <p>Here's a breakdown of courses I have tutored: introduction to computer science, data structures, algorithms, calculus I-III, proofs and fundamentals,test prep: AMC, SAT, ACT, ISEE, SHSAT</p>
  <p>As a statistics Ph.D student, I have TA'd for the following courses: introduction to statistics (both with and without calculus), linera regression models, statistical inference, and several variations of these courses. </p>
  <p>My respinsibilities as a teaching assistant include holding weekly office hours for 30-100 students, grading exams, providing homework solutions, and holding recitation sessions. As a recitation leader, I hold brief lectures on weekly topics, and go over sample problems in front of the class.</p>
